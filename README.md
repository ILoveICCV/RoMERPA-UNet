<h1> RoMERPA-UNet: Robust Medical Image Segmentation with Multi-frequency Edge Refinement and Prompt-guided Attention </h1>
</div>

## 🎈 News

- [2025.2.19] Training and inference code released

## ⭐ Abstract

Medical image segmentation faces numerous challenges, particularly in exploring multi-scale and multi-frequency features for effective edge detection and noise suppression. Plus, enhancing the model's adaptability and generalization ability in diverse pathological images is an urgent issue. 
To address problems, we propose RoMERPA-UNet, which incorporates two key blocks: the Edge Detection Block (EDB) and the Hybrid Prompt Block (HPB). 
The EDB uses multi-scale convolutions to enhance feature maps, and further separates multi-frequency information. High-frequency components are used to capture boundaries of salient objects, while low-frequency components help suppress noise introduced by non-salient objects. Meanwhile, by combining multi-directional with fine-grained global-local offsets, the model's adaptability to irregular edges is optimized. 
The HPB improves generalization performance by generating high-frequency and low-frequency prompt masks and combining them with prompt-guided cross-attention to extract transferable segmentation features applicable to various medical cases. 
Evaluation results on seven public datasets indicate that RoMERPA-UNet outperforms eleven existing advanced methods in segmentation accuracy.
